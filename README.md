Hello, we're Hexxed BitHeadz!  We are currently studying red team cyber topics, ranging from OSCP to Red Team Operator, with malware development around the corner.  We have a site at https://hexxedbitheadz.com where we post topics once a month, and technical blogs a few times a year.  We have just ordered our first Rasberry Pi 5's, and cannot wait to jump and set up some hack-y stuff!

 HexxedBitHeadz consists of just a few like-minded individuals looking for creative ways to become more involved in the world of cyber.
